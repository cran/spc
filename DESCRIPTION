Description: Evaluation of control charts by means of
        the zero-state, steady-state ARL (Average Run Length).
        Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL
        and plotting of the related figures. The control charts
        under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA and
        CUSUM charts for monitoring the mean of normally
        distributed independent data. Now, the ARL calculation
        of EWMA-S^2 control charts is added. Moreover,
        with a further new function so-called tolerance limits
        factors could be determined.
        Other charts and
        parameters are in preparation. Further SPC areas will
        be covered as well (sampling plans, capability indices ...).
