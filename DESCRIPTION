Description: Evaluation of control charts by means of
        the zero-state, steady-state ARL (Average Run Length) and RL quantiles.
        Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL. The control charts
        under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA, CUSUM, and
        Shiryaev-Roberts schemes for monitoring the mean of normally
        distributed independent data. ARL calculation
        of the same set of schemes under drift are added. 
        Other charts and parameters are in preparation.
        Further SPC areas will be covered as well
        (sampling plans, capability indices ...).
