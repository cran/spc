Description: Evaluation of control charts by means of the zero-state,
        steady-state ARL (Average Run Length) and RL quantiles.
        Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL. The control
        charts under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA, CUSUM,
        and Shiryaev-Roberts schemes for monitoring the mean of
        normally distributed independent data. ARL calculation of the
        same set of schemes under drift are added.  Other charts and
        parameters are in preparation.  Further SPC areas will be
        covered as well (sampling plans, capability indices ...).
