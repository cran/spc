Description: Evaluation of control charts by means of
        the zero-state, steady-state ARL (Average Run Length).
        Setting up control charts for given in-control ARL
        and plotting of the related figures. The control charts
        under consideration are one- and two-sided EWMA and
        CUSUM charts for monitoring the mean of normally
        distributed independent data. Other charts and
        parameters are in preparation. Further SPC areas will
        be covered as well (sampling plans, capability indices ...).
